# Netflix like website
Hi, it's my Netflix like pet project. There is only frontend part of whole application (server part not mine). Here you can find widgets for CRUD operations with movies using Axios and state management using React Redux. Markup with styles were created in Html and Css without adding additional libraries. Also there are some tests including e2e and unit.
To install all required dependencies use 
### npm install
To start the project use
### npm run start
